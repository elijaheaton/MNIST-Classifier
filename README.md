# MNIST-Classifier
A neural network to classify the MNIST collection of handwritten numbers.
The version 1 network, created on June 19, 2020 runs at about a 90% success rate, 
which is less than the average rate for human comprehension. See Wikipedia for details:

Version 2 was created on June 22, 2020, and has a much better accuracy of 98%. Some improvements
I made were to include dropouts, regularize the data, and use activation functions.
